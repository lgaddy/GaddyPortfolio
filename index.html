    <h1>Hello, my name is LaKenya Gaddy</h1>
      
      <p>Thank you for checking out my page. Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am 27 years old born and raised in Detroit. I graduated from Cass Technical High School before making my journey to Oakland University. I currently live in Southfield, MI where I am a Help Desk Representative for a MSP/Staffing Agency. I love being active I ride my bike everyday to work and walk the nature trails on the weekend. My ultimate dream is to see as many palm trees as I possibly can aka travel the world and layout on all the beaches.
